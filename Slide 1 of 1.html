<ol>
	<li>Don't try this in PM2 until Efe upgrades to C# version 7.3 (kind of works on 7.0 but not really)</li>
	<li>I may get confused with some of the Casting but I have the result file so I can copy and paste it in</li>
	<li>There is a Bug in C# but has a work around which I will use.</li>
	<li><b><i>Not everything demonstrated in this presentation is a good idea.  Use good judgment before jumping off the bridge</i></b></li>
